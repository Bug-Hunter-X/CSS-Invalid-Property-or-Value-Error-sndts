# CSS Invalid Property or Value Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet often tricky CSS bug: using an invalid property or value.  This can lead to frustrating debugging sessions, as the error might not always be immediately apparent.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.css` file shows the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of using a CSS linter or validator to catch such errors early in the development process.
